## Project Overview

LifeSpectrum, in collaboration with Pearson Specter Hospital, aims to analyze patient data to gain insights into lifestyle and behavioral impacts on stroke outcomes. The project employs multiple machine learning techniques to predict stroke risk and offers actionable insights to improve healthcare strategies.

## Data Source

The dataset used in this project was obtained from [Kaggle: Indicators of Heart Disease (2022 Update)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kamilpytlak/personal-key-indicators-of-heart-disease).

## Objectives

The primary objective is to identify significant patterns in health determinants that contribute to stroke risk. Key goals include:

- Analyzing the relationship between physical health and stroke likelihood.
- Determining the impact of BMI/obesity on stroke risk.
- Estimating stroke risk based on various health indicators.

## Methodology

1. **Data Preparation**: Data collection, cleaning, and preprocessing.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, and data visualization.
3. **Predictive Modeling**: Implementing various classification models, including Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Na√Øve Bayes, and Ensemble Stacking.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Comparing model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.
5. **Insights and Recommendations**: Interpreting results and providing actionable insights for health interventions.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Jupyter Notebook
